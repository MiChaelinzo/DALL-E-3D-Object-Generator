# DALL-E-3D-Object-Generator
This code uses OpenAI's DALL-E API to generate 3D models of objects based on textual prompts. The script sends a request to the DALL-E API with a specified text prompt and generates a 3D model image of the object described in the prompt. The script uses the Pillow library to save the generated image to disk. The project demonstrates the capabilities of the DALL-E API and the potential for using AI to generate 3D models based on natural language descriptions.
